# Course Search API

A Spring Boot application that provides course search functionality using Elasticsearch.

## üéØ Project Overview

This application indexes course documents into Elasticsearch and exposes REST endpoints for:
- Searching courses with multiple filters, pagination, and sorting
- Autocomplete suggestions for course titles (Bonus)
- Fuzzy matching for course titles (Bonus)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Java**: 21
- **Spring Boot**: 3.1.5
- **Elasticsearch**: 8.11.0
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For Elasticsearch setup
- **Maven**: Build tool

## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Maven 3.6+
- Git

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adidhakane/course-search-api-submission
cd course-search-api
```
### 2. Start Docker Desktop & then Elasticsearch
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
### 3. Wait for sometime (1 or 2 minutes) & then is Verify Elasticsearch is Running
```bash
   curl http://localhost:9200
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_name" : "course-search-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "...",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.11.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```
### 4. Check Cluster Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
```
### 5. Build and Run the Application
```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
```
### 6. Verify Application is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
Expected response: "Course Search API is running!"
```
## üìä Sample Data
The application includes 50+ sample course documents with the following fields:

]
}
```
## üéØ Bonus Features
### Autocomplete Suggestions
```http
GET /api/search/suggest?q={partialTitle}
```

#### Example Requests:
```bash
# Get suggestions for partial title
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search/suggest?q=art"
```
#### Response Format:
```json
[
  "Creative Art Workshop","Digital Art and Design"
]
```

### Fuzzy Search
The main search endpoint supports fuzzy matching for handling typos in search queries.

#### Example Requests:
```bash
# Get suggestions for partial title
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=methemetics"
```
#### Response Format:
```json
{"total":2,"courses":[{"id":"course-001","title":"Advanced Mathematics for Young Minds","description":"Explore complex mathematical concepts through fun activities and problem-solving exercises designed for curious young mathematicians.","category":"Math","type":"COURSE","gradeRange":"4th-6th","minAge":9,"maxAge":12,"price":150.0,"nextSessionDate":"2025-07-20T10:00:00Z","titleSuggest":"Advanced Mathematics for Young Minds"},{"id":"course-049","title":"Calculus Introduction","description":"Early introduction to calculus concepts for advanced mathematics students, focusing on limits and derivatives.","category":"Math","type":"COURSE","gradeRange":"9th-12th","minAge":14,"maxAge":18,"price":250.0,"nextSessionDate":"2025-09-04T15:00:00Z","titleSuggest":"Calculus Introduction"}]}
```

## üß™ Testing
### Manual Testing Examples

#### Test Fuzzy Search:
```bash
# Search with typo - should still find "Dinosaur Discovery"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=dinors"

# Another typo test - should find "Robotics"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=robtics"

# Math typo - should find "Mathematics"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=mathmatics"

# Physics typo - should find "Physics"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=phisics"
```
#### Test Filters:
```bash
# Find courses for 8-10 year olds
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?minAge=8&maxAge=10"

# Find affordable courses under $100
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?maxPrice=100&sort=priceAsc"

# Find upcoming Science courses
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?category=Science&startDate=2025-07-15T00:00:00Z&sort=upcoming"
```
#### Test Sorting:
```bash
# Cheapest courses first
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?sort=priceAsc&size=5"

# Most expensive courses first  
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?sort=priceDesc&size=5"

# Upcoming courses (default)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?sort=upcoming&size=5"
```

### Automated Testing
Run the run tests script in a new terminal with root directory:
```bash
chmod +x quick-test.sh #or relavent windows command
./run-tests.sh 
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run only integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=*IntegrationTest
```

### Elasticsearch Configuration
- Host: localhost
- Port: 9200
- Index: courses

### Application Properties
```properties
spring.elasticsearch.uris=http://localhost:9200
spring.elasticsearch.connection-timeout=10s
spring.elasticsearch.socket-timeout=30s
logging.level.com.undoschool.coursesearch=INFO
```
## üìù Sample Data Categories
